Fix Windows compatibility.

Going to / from fullscreen on OS X does not resize correctly sometimes

Add the ability to repeat frames on OS X, as the glx SGI OpenGL extensions
used under Linux are not available
   
Add a control panel dialog box, to adjust the parameters that are currently
set on the command line.
   
Write some better documentation

Add the option to use 0,1 or 2 PBOs as described at www.songho.ca/opengl/gl_pbo.html

On OSX, use the apple specific extensions for reducing the number of texture copies that are made.
See http://developer.apple.com/documentation/GraphicsImaging/Conceptual/OpenGL-MacProgGuide/opengl_texturedata/chapter_10_section_2.html

Make the --loop option have a parameter which specifies the number of times to repeat a file

Tidy up the main loop in GLvideo_rt, it is a bit messy at the moment
