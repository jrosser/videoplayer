Prerequisites
=============
There are few pre-requisites for building the application:
 - Qt: 4.2.3[1] or later, http://qt.nokia.com/
 - GLEW: OpenGL extension handler, http://glew.sourceforge.net/
 - Freetype2: for optional On Screen Display, http://www.freetype.org/

 [1] - NB, as of writing, the oldest development system i use has
       Qt 4.7.x.  Older versions may not work any more.


Building
========
There are two ways to prepare a build environment for videoplayer:
 - Using configure
 - Using qmake


Building with qmake
-------------------
The general method for using qmake is:
  $ mkdir /some/build/dir
  $ cd /some/build/dir
  $ edit local.pro #if required
  $ qmake /path/to/videoplayer-source/src/videoplayer.pro
  $ make

To disable the OSD, add the following to "local.pro": DEFINES -= WITH_OSD

Building with configure
-----------------------
The general method for using configure is:
  $ mkdir /some/build/dir
  $ cd /some/build/dir
  $ /path/to/videoplayer-source/configure
  $ make

To disable the OSD, run configure with --disable-osd


Platform specific notes: OSX
============================
 - Pre-built Qt binaries are available from the Qt website.
 - The simplest method for installing GLEW and Freetype is to use macports.
   Ensure that /opt/local/bin is in $PATH.
 - With qmake:
    - Use "qmake -spec macx-g++"
    - If Videoplayer application will complain that the OSD font cannot be
      found, run macdeployqt Videoplayer.app
 - The "configure" script may be used as an alternative to qmake.


Platform specific notes: Windows
================================
 - Building anything with windows is always an unsatisfying experience.
 - Pre-built Qt binaries are available from the Qt website.
 - It is recommended to use the following precompiled libraries:
     freetype: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/freetype.htm
         glew: http://glew.sourceforge.net/

   Add the following to "local.pro":
     GLEWDIR = z:/path/to/glew/
     FREETYPEDIR = z:/path/to/freetype/

 - If the pre-compiled libraries are not used, "local.pro" may need updating
   to include suitable "LIBS += ..." and "INCLUDES += ..." directives.

 - MSVC, ICC or Mingw can be used to compile the application.
 - Use "nmake" instead of "make".
 - It is not recommended to use the "configure" method.

Platform specific notes: Linux
==============================
 - Install the development packages for Qt, GLEW and Freetype from your
   distribution.
 - It is suggested to use the "configure" method, although "qmake" works too.
