Videoplayer is a program designed to allow the real time playback of raw,
headerless YUV files that are encountered in video processing and broadcast
applications.

The source data should be a single file of concatenated video frames.

Aims
----

* Play video locked exactly to the display device refresh rate (VSYNC)

* Play back uncompressed video in real time

* Offload chrominance upconversion and colour matrixing to the GPU
  to permit high performance playback.

Source Formats
--------------

Videoplayer provides compatibility with a wide range of YUV formats:

FourCC code     Description
-----------     -----------
I420            YUV planar 8 bit data

YV12            YVU planar 8 bit data

UYVY            UYVY multiplexed 8 bit data

V210            UYVY multiplexed 10 bit data, 3 components packed into 32 bits

V216            UYVY multiplexed 8-16 bit data, little endian,
                data packed to the most significant bits

16P0            16 bit, MSbyte first, 16 bit planar data, 4:2:0 chroma

16P2            16 bit, MSbyte first, 16 bit planar data, 4:2:2 chroma

16P4            16 bit, MSbyte first, 16 bit planar data, 4:4:4 chroma

Operating System Compatibility
------------------------------

Videoplayer has been developed using the Qt cross platform toolkit.

The software has been tested on:
 - Linux/X11 (with nVidia and Intel graphics drivers)
 - OSX 10.5  (with nVidia and ATI graphics drivers)
 - WindowsXP (with nVidia and Intel graphics drivers)

Primary development occurs on a Linux/X11 platform.

There is a known issue with playback on Windows systems with Intel graphics
drivers.  On these systems the WGL SwapBuffers call does not block, which is
required for moderating the playback speed.

Hardware Requirements
---------------------

Playing uncompressed video sources requires significant read bandwidth from
a storage device:

            ||              FourCC
  Standard  ||   I420   |   UYVY   |   V210   |   V216
  ----------++----------+----------+----------+----------
    576i25  ||  15 MB/s |  20 MB/s |  27 MB/s |  41 MB/s
   1080p25  ||  77 MB/s | 103 MB/s | 138 MB/s | 207 MB/s
   1080p50  || 155 MB/s | 207 MB/s | 276 MB/s | 414 MB/s
   3260p60  || 746 MB/s | 995 MB/s | 1.3 GB/s | 1.6 GB/s

It should be noted that the continuous read rate of a HDD varies across the
platters. It may be possible to play back from fewer disks than described
above, but frames may be dropped at certain filesystem occupancies.

The videoplayer will attempt to use a read ahead buffer to aid guaranteeing
average throughput.  The size of the buffer is customizable.

Videoplayer uses OpenGL to accelerate playback. Development has been done with
NVidia QuadroFX3450, 6600GT, 8600GT and 8800GT cards. Recent PCIe graphics cards
are recommended, but no testing of other models has been done.
